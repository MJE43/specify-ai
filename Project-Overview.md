# Project Overview

Specify-AI is a web application that helps non-technical founders create clear project specifications and documentation. This documentation will then be used to guide AI code generation tools in IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf to build web applications effectively.

The application should:

Collect Project Information: Guide users through a simple questionnaire to gather essential details about their project's goals, tech needs, and user experience.

Generate Documentation: Use AI (like Gemini) to automatically create the following, clear, structured documents based on the user's questionnaire responses:

Project Requirements: Outlines the project's goals, scope, features, and constraints.

Backend Structure: Details the backend architecture, API endpoints, and data models.

Tech Stack: Specifies the technologies, tools, and frameworks to be used.

Frontend Guidelines: Provides guidelines for the frontend UI/UX, component structure, and state management.

File Structure: Defines the project's file and folder organization.

App Flow: Diagram showing user flows, data flows, state transitions, API interactions, and error handling.

System Prompts (For the coding LLM): Provides specific instructions for how to use an LLM to build the application.

This application focuses on generating specifications and documentation for AI code generators, it is not an AI code generator itself. The "System Prompts" are designed to guide the AI that will be creating the code for the project.

**Key Goal: Make it easy for non-technical founders to define their project clearly so that they can use AI code generators effectively.**
